<p>I am currently majoring in communication studies with a minor in info science and technology. 
I call home to Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.
I enjoy the outdoors and anything that allows me to express my creative abitilits through technology 
and graphic interfaces like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro. These interfaces allow me to
express my creativity through video editing, and digital photography; two of my biggest past times.</p>

<p>In my free time I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family as well as working with 
children in the community. I have participated in both volunteer and employed child care for over four 
years which has allowed me to meet local families and participate in events that have shaped the person 
I am today. </p>

<p>You've come this far, I assure you I will somehow get you to laugh or smile before your journey 
through my site is over, and hopefully by the end of it all, we can meet in person! I like to think 
I can bring out the best in people so if I can make you laugh aside from your interest in my skills 
and abilities, I assure you I can be a great asset to your business!</p>
