<p>These are both past and current projects I have completed or 
started working on both as in class assignments and things I do 
on my own time. A lot of my video editing projects have come from 
the video editing course I have completed at CSU which was one of 
my favorite courses in my college career by far. Other items are 
prominant writing assignments or images I have edited in other courses.</p>
